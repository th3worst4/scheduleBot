# scheduleBot
 Simple Telegram bot that allows me to see my college schedule

The Telegram bot tolkien is missing because it's like a password to control the bot. If you want to use this code, I recommend you create your very own bot and add the tolkien manually.

Besides that, the file "Cronograma.xlsx" is missing too, because it was the Excel file with my college schedule. You can create your own and change the path and file name in "excelFunctions.py". Any doubts, I'm available to help you, just send me an e-mail!

The "runBot.bat" is a Windows file that allows the user to pre-set some cmd/PowerShell instructions. If you have Python installed and made the needed changes for the bot works, you can just click on it and you PC will work as a server for the bot.
